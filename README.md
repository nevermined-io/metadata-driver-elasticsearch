## Features

Elasticsearch driver to connect implementing MetadataDB.

## Prerequisites

You should have running a elasticsearch instance.

## Quickstart

First of all we have to specify where is allocated our config.
To do that we have to pass the following argument:

```
--config=/path/of/my/config
```

If you do not provide a configuration path, by default the config is expected in the config folder.

In the configuration we are going to specify the following parameters to

```yaml
    [metadatadb]

    enabled=true            # In order to enable or not the plugin
    module=elasticsearch    # You can use one the plugins already created. Currently we have elasticsearch, mongodb and bigchaindb.
    module.path=            # You can specify the location of your custom plugin.
    db.hostname=localhost   # Address of your Elasticsearch instance.
    db.port=9200            # Port of your Elasticsearch rest API.
    db.username=elastic     # If you are using authentication, elasticsearch username.
    db.password=changeme    # If you are using authentication, elasticsearch password.
    db.index=metadatadb     # Elasticsearch index name
```

Once you have defined this the only thing that you have to do it is use it:

```python

    metadatadb = MetadataDB(conf)
    metadatadb.write({"value": "test"}, id)

```

## Environment variables

When you want to instantiate an Metadatadb plugin you can provide the next environment variables:

- **$CONFIG_PATH**
- **$MODULE**
- **$DB_HOSTNAME**
- **$DB_PORT**
- **$DB_INDEX**
- **$DB_USERNAME**
- **$DB_PASSWORD**


## Queries

Currently we are supporting a list of queries predefined in order to improve the search:
All this queries present a common format: 
```query:{"name":[args]}```

This queries are the following:
- price
    
    Could receive one or two parameters. If you only pass one assumes that your query is going to start from 0 to your value.
        
    Next query:
    `query:{"price":[0,10]}`
    
    It is transformed to:
    `{"service.metadata.base.price":{"$gt": 0, "$lt": 10}}`
        
- license
    
    It is going to retrieve all the documents with license that you are passing in the parameters, 
    if you do not pass any value retrieve all.
        
    `{"license":["Public domain", "CC-YB"]}`
    
- type
    
    It is going to check that the following service types are included in the ddo.
    
    `{"type":["Access", "Metadata"]}`

- sample

    Check that the metadata include a sample that contains a link of type sample. Do not take parameters.
    
    `{"sample":[]}`
    
- categories

    Retrieve all the values that contain one of the specifies categories.
    
    `{"categories":["weather", "meteorology"]}`
    
- created

    Retrieve all the values that has been created between two dates. 

    `{"created":['2016-02-07T16:02:20Z', '2016-02-09T16:02:20Z']}`
    
- dateCreated

    Retrieve all the values that has been created between two dates. 
    
    `{"dateCreated":['2016-02-07T16:02:20Z', '2016-02-09T16:02:20Z']}`
    
- datePublished

    Retrieve all the values that has been published between two dates. 
    
    `{"datePublished":['2016-02-07T16:02:20Z', '2016-02-09T16:02:20Z']}`
    
- updatedFrequency

    Retrieve all the values that contain one of the specifies updated frecuencies.
    
    `{"updatedFrequency":["monthly"]}`

- text
    Retrieve all the values that match with the text sent.
    
    `{"text":["weather"]}`

- did
    Retrieve all the matching dids.
    
    `{"did":["did:nv:1..,did:nv:2.."]}`


## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Github actions.
Our test use pytest framework.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
